World-class teams metabolize chaos. Calm teams break.

Most leaders chase calm. They file down surprises, tune meetings, and polish checklists. They hunt
surprises like a hospital infection team. Calm passes for competence because it looks like control. It keeps leaders out of blame.

So companies build cushions: meetings that decide for you, roles that absorb risk, rituals that
launder uncertainty into status updates. The failure mode has a name: **exporting responsibility
upward.** Decisions centralize. Ownership diffuses. Everyone looks aligned while nobody owns the
outcome.

It feels like good management—absorbing chaos so others can focus. But taking responsibility _for_
people isn't the same as developing people who can take responsibility. The former creates calm. The
latter creates capability. Only one survives contact with reality.

Calm organizations don't get strong. They get good at calm. Then they get brittle. When the first
real hit comes, they shatter. The result isn't stability. It's learned helplessness dressed as good
calendar hygiene.

There's another way: **directed chaos**—practice under load. Small, controlled storms that teach
people how to sail. The sea is never calm. But navigation can be steady if the right person is
steering.

You build resilience the way you build muscle: stress, recover, repeat. Resilience isn't the absence
of chaos; it's the ability to metabolize it.

## The pattern

Every change that worked used one move: **remove a cushion, then add structure.**

Removal alone sparks panic. Structure alone creates theater. The move is paired. You take away the
thing that did the thinking. You replace it with something that makes thinking survivable.

A cushion is anything that keeps you from doing the difficult thinking yourself—a process, a role, a
meeting, a ritual that has become a crutch. Good structure is different: not something that does the
work for people, but something that makes it safe to do the work themselves.

What changes is where responsibility lands—and where it's felt.

If the system feels calm, ask: _What cushion is doing our thinking for us?_

Here’s the cleanest example I have.

## The meeting that couldn't die

When I arrived at GrowthLoop, one Scrum meeting was the company's spine: 30 minutes for 25 engineers
and 2 PMs across five "teams." A round-robin of thin updates, a parade of "blocked," and a dopamine
hit of alignment.

Everyone left nodding. Work still slipped. Tidy, performative calm.

Underneath, work was ticket soup: ad hoc initiatives that belonged to "teams" who shared blame but
not conviction. The meeting was the cushion that absorbed responsibility so nobody had to.

Everyone "loved" the meeting, but if a meeting can't die, it's not a tool—it's a religion.

So I didn't refactor it. I deleted it.

We didn't stop coordinating. We stopped pretending coordination was a meeting. Planning didn't go
away. The fiction that one meeting could plan for everyone did.

The deletion produced the most valuable artifact in the company: empty space. Within hours my Slack
filled with DMs asking for a replacement ceremony, a new playbook, a definitive timebox. I said
no—not because structure is bad, but because this structure had become a cast. Casts prevent injury.
Left on too long, they prevent growth.

The first week was loud in the right way. Teams argued about planning. Leads looked around and
realized there was no parent to escalate to. Two leads tried to resurrect the central meeting and
learned why it existed: to export responsibility upward. Without a center, there was nowhere to
export to. So they stopped looking.

Then the experimentation started. Some did it well on the first pass. Others stumbled, then learned.
Either way, they were thinking. That was the point.

But deletion alone is just chaos. Chaos needs a wall to push against.

**Freedom without structure is chaos. Structure without freedom is bureaucracy.** The magic is in
the tension.

So we added structure that doesn't steer for you.

Projects became the atomic unit of work: a bounded bet with a finish line. Each project had a
load-bearing owner—not a committee. We named the role **champion**, and that word did real work.

A champion isn't a PM with a new hat. It's the person who carries the project when it gets heavy.
They cut scope, pull in the right people, and say what's true. Their name stays attached when the
project is ugly. If there's no champion, it's not a project. It's a wish.

Every six weeks champions sit with the exec team and walk through the guts in plain language. No
slide theater. No green/yellow/red. Just: what's true, what changed, what's at risk, and what you're
doing about it.

That review isn't approval. It's forced contact with reality—an engineered place to surface
uncertainty on purpose and treat it as a signal, not a sin.

That was the pattern: remove the cushion that exported responsibility, add structure that
concentrated it.

## The payoff

There's a quiet moment when it starts to stick.

People start solving problems before you know the problems exist. PMs stop apologizing for slowing
features—they ask what they can do to help. Engineers defend customers with test suites they wrote
without being asked.

**Ownership isn't a belief you argue someone into. It's a weight you let them feel.**

The people who thrive here don't just tolerate turbulence—they generate it. I call them
**exothermic**: they produce more energy than they consume. They bring drafts instead of questions.
They kill ambiguity for everyone around them.

Directed chaos doesn't just build resilience—it builds exothermic people.

## The invitation

None of this is a plea for reckless change. Unmanaged chaos breaks people. Directed chaos makes
them.

You expose your people to waves, but you go through it with them. You give them structure. You don't
flinch in the first storm. And then, the next time, they don't either.

Resilience isn't something you can give people. It's something they build by going through storms.
If you want a resilient company, stop promising calm seas.

Give them storms worth weathering. Teach them to yearn for the sea. Then give them a ship worth
sailing.
