World-class teams metabolize chaos. Calm teams break.

Most leaders try to make work calm. They file down surprises, tune meetings, polish checklists. They
hunt surprises like a hospital infection team. Calm looks like competence.

But calm organizations don't get strong. They get good at calm. Then they get brittle. When the
first real hit comes, they shatter.

There's another way. I call it **directed chaos**: practice under load—small, controlled storms that
teach people how to sail. Resilience isn't the absence of chaos; it's the ability to metabolize it.
You build it the way you build muscle: stress, recovery, repeat. If you can't recover from the dose,
you're not building resilience. You're just injuring people.

I didn't learn this from a clever framework. I learned it the only way that counts: I made changes
and kept what survived.

## The pattern

Every change that worked used the same move: **remove a cushion, then add structure.**

**If you can't stop it, you don't get to start it.**

Removal alone sparks panic. Structure alone creates theater. The move is paired. You take away the
thing that did the thinking. You replace it with something that makes thinking survivable.

The cushion might be a process, a role, a meeting, or a ritual that has become a crutch. The
structure is a different kind of support—not one that does the work for people, but one that makes
it safe to do the work themselves.

What changes is where responsibility lands—and whether people feel it.

If the system feels calm, ask:

_What cushion is doing our thinking for us?_

## Remove the center

When I arrived at GrowthLoop, one Scrum meeting was the company's spine. It was tidy and numbing.
Everyone left nodding—and nothing changed.

I didn't refactor it. I deleted it.

If a meeting can't die, it's not a tool—it's a religion.

We didn't stop coordinating. We stopped pretending coordination was a meeting. Planning didn't go
away. The fiction that one meeting could plan for everyone did.

The deletion produced the most valuable artifact in the company: empty space.

Within hours my Slack filled with DMs asking for a replacement ceremony, a new playbook, a
definitive timebox. I said no.

Not because structure is bad. Because this structure had become a cast.

Casts prevent injury. Left on too long, they prevent growth.

The first week was loud in the right way. Teams argued about planning. Leads looked around and
realized there was no parent to escalate to.

Two leads tried to resurrect it. They discovered the old ritual's real purpose: exporting
responsibility upward. Without a center, there was nowhere to export it. So they stopped looking.

Some did it well on the first pass. Others stumbled, then learned. Either way, they were thinking.
That was the point.

It turned out "calm" had been disguising learned helplessness. Remove the disguise and you don't get
serenity. You get noise. That's atrophied muscle waking up.

But deletion alone is just chaos. Chaos needs a wall to push against.

## Add structure

Deleting the central meeting left a vacuum. Judgment needs friction.

**Freedom without structure is chaos. Structure without freedom is bureaucracy.**

The magic is in the tension.

So we added structure that doesn't steer for you.

Projects became the atomic unit of work. Each one had a load-bearing champion—a name, not a
committee.

Every six weeks those champions sit with the exec team and walk through the guts in plain language.
No slide theater. No green/yellow/red. Just: what's true, what changed, what's at risk?

That cadence gives people a place to bring uncertainty on purpose. It gives leadership a chance to
reinforce that uncertainty isn't a sin—it's a signal. The cadence is a metronome for reality. It
forces reality onto the calendar.

This was the structure that made the removal not just survivable, but valuable.

Not all structure is process. Sometimes it's a word that ends arguments.

We normalized **desired state**. When someone proposed a patch, I'd stop them and ask them to
describe the system we wished we already had—concrete, not dreamy.

Patches shifted from "how do we hide this hole?" to "what's one brick we can lay the right way?" It
sounds semantic until you do it in a meeting and feel the room tilt from firefighting to
architecture.

Desired state does two things: it forces you to name the shape of the problem, and it absolves you
of fixing all of it right now. You just have to move one notch toward what you actually want.

## Remove the safety net

The same pattern guided one of the most controversial changes we made: we dropped QA as a separate
function.

We didn't drop testing. We dropped the idea that quality lives in another department.

Not because quality doesn't matter. Because quality had become something you got from another team,
like a notarized stamp. Engineers would write code, toss it over, and wait for absolution.
Responsibility diffused in proportion to the number of handoffs.

We removed the handoff. Ownership didn't vanish—it concentrated. The release checklist moved to the
person who wrote the code—and their name stayed on it.

The first cycle was messy on purpose. We shipped bugs we used to pay someone else to catch. We
reverted. We apologized. It felt wrong for about a week and necessary by the second.

Engineers started writing better tests because there was no one else to write them. Reviews got
sharper because the cost of a lazy review arrived at your door, not someone else's.

**Ownership isn't a belief you argue someone into. It's a weight you let them feel.**

Ownership fixed one half of the problem: quality. Attention was the other half.

We needed a word that could stop the line.

**Code Red** did that work.

When everything is urgent, nothing is. Our platform started thrashing as we moved upmarket. The team
felt it, customers felt it, and we were still juggling feature work like nothing had changed.
Everyone knew something was wrong, but nobody had license to say it.

Calling a Code Red didn't create panic. It created calm. Suddenly pausing the roadmap wasn't a
personal failure—it was a company decision. People don't burn out from hard work. They burn out from
ambiguous work. Code Red removed the ambiguity.

I regret not calling it earlier. The minute we did, the heaviest rocks started to move.

A good word doesn't just describe reality. It changes what people can do next.

## The payoff

There's a quiet moment when it starts to stick.

Engineers defend customers with test suites they wrote without being asked. PMs stop apologizing for
slowing a feature during a Code Red. They ask what they can do to help. People start solving
problems before you know the problems exist.

The people who thrive in this environment don't just tolerate turbulence—they generate it. They pick
fights with reality before reality picks one for them.

I call these people **exothermic**: they produce more energy than they consume.

Endothermic people can be brilliant—but they are a tax. Exothermic people are a generator.

Once you have the word, you can hire for it and coach it. "Be more exothermic" isn't vague when you
can translate it to: close the loop before you leave the room. Don't wait for permission to think.

They bring drafts instead of questions. They kill ambiguity for the people around them. They make
everyone faster.

That's not a trait. It's what ownership plus clarity produce.

Directed chaos doesn't just build resilience—it builds exothermic people.

The surface still looks busy. Underneath, there's a steadiness you can't get by chasing calm. It
comes from rough seas, not still water.

## The invitation

None of this is a plea for reckless change. Unmanaged chaos breaks people. Directed chaos makes
them.

You expose your people to turbulence, but you go through it with them. You give them structure. You
give them language. You don't flinch in the first storm.

And then, the next time, they don't either.

Change is exhausting. The part you can control is its dose and its direction.

The hard part isn't inventing changes. It's choosing a small set that reinforce each other—then
tolerating the boredom of repetition. The boredom is a sign you're building muscle. Around the third
cycle, the system starts saying it back to you.

If you want one tactic to steal tomorrow: forbid patches for the first ten minutes of your next
decision meeting. Make the team write the desired state in plain words. Then pick the one step you
can take this week that moves you toward it.

The debate shrinks. Morale rises. People can tolerate pain if they believe it's directional.

**Chaos without cadence is panic. Cadence without chaos is theater.**

The paradox is that if you do this long enough, calm returns. Not the fragile calm of a team that's
never been tested, but the earned calm of one that has weathered real storms.

Resilience isn't something you can give people. It's something they build by going through storms.
If you want a resilient company, stop promising calm seas.

So give them storms worth weathering. Teach them to yearn for the sea. Then give them a ship worth
sailing.
