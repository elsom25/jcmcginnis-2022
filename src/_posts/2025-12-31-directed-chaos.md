Most leaders try to make work calm. They spend their energy eliminating surprises, tuning meetings,
adding checklists. Calm looks like competence.

The problem is that calm organizations don't get stronger. They get brittle. The first real hit
shatters them.

Resilience comes from exposure to disorder—not protection from it. You inject chaos in controlled
doses so your team builds the muscle to handle it. You can't train that capacity by shielding people
from turbulence. You train it by creating turbulence.

I learned this the only way that matters: by making changes and watching which ones stuck.

## The pattern

Every change that worked followed the same move: **remove a cushion, then add structure**.

Removal alone creates panic. Structure alone creates theater. The move is always paired: you take
away something that blocked thinking, and you replace it with something that makes thinking
survivable.

The cushion might be a process, a role, or a ritual that has become a crutch. The structure is a
different kind of support—not one that does the work for people, but one that makes it safe for them
to do the work themselves.

What changes is where responsibility lands. And whether people actually feel it.

## Remove the center

When I arrived at GrowthLoop, there was a central Scrum that acted like a spinal cord for the whole
org. It was tidy, performative, and numbing. Everyone left "aligned" and nobody moved.

I didn't refactor it. I removed it.

The deletion produced the most valuable artifact in the company: empty space. Within hours I had
messages asking for a replacement ceremony, a new playbook, a definitive timebox. I said no. Not
because structure is bad, but because this structure had become a cast. Casts prevent injury; left
on too long, they prevent growth.

The first week was loud in the right way. Teams argued about planning. Leads looked around and
realized they were the adults in the room. Two leads tried to re-create it; they discovered that the
old ritual's purpose had been to export responsibility upward. Without a center, there was nowhere
to export it. So they stopped looking.

Some did it well on the first pass. Others stumbled, then learned. But they were thinking.

It turned out "calm" had been disguising learned helplessness. Remove the disguise and you don't get
serenity. You get noise. That noise is the sound of atrophied muscles starting to fire.

## Add structure

Deleting the central meeting left a vacuum. Agency needs something to push against. Freedom without
structure is chaos. Structure without freedom is bureaucracy. The magic is in the tension.

So we added structure that dignifies freedom.

Projects became the atomic unit of work, each with a load-bearing champion—a name, not a committee.
Every six weeks those champions sit with the exec team and walk through details in plain language.
No slide theater. No green/yellow/red. Just: what's true, what changed, what's at risk?

The cadence gives people a place to bring uncertainty on purpose. It gives leadership a chance to
reinforce that uncertainty isn't a sin—it's a signal.

This was the structure that made the removal not just survivable, but valuable.

## Remove the safety net

The same pattern guided one of the most controversial changes we made: we dropped QA as a separate
function.

Not because quality doesn't matter. Because quality had become something you got from another team,
like a notarized stamp. Engineers would write code, toss it over, and wait for absolution.
Responsibility diffused in proportion to the number of handoffs.

We removed the handoff.

The first cycle was predictably messy. We shipped bugs that would have been caught. We reverted. We
apologized. It felt wrong for about a week and necessary by the second.

Engineers started writing better tests because there was no one else to write them. Reviews got
sharper because the cost of a lazy review arrived at your door, not someone else's.

**Ownership isn't a belief you argue someone into. It's a weight you let them feel.**

## Language as infrastructure

People don't move from obedience to judgment on willpower alone. Many have been trained for years
that independent judgment is how you get in trouble. So you give them structure—but the right kind.

Language is one of the most underrated structures you can add. Words seem soft, but chosen
carefully, they become load-bearing. A shared vocabulary compresses judgment. It lets people make
decisions without escalating, because the criteria are already embedded in the terms they use.

The right word ends debates before they start. It gives permission without requiring approval. It
makes the implicit explicit—and once something is explicit, people can act on it.

Here's one that did a lot of work for us: **Code Red**.

When everything is urgent, nothing is. Our platform started thrashing as we moved upmarket. The team
felt it, customers felt it, and we were still juggling feature work like nothing had changed.
Everyone knew something was wrong, but nobody had license to say it.

Declaring a Code Red did not create panic. It created calm. Suddenly it was not a personal failure
to pause your roadmap—it was a company decision. People don't burn out from hard work. They burn out
from ambiguous work. Code Red removed the ambiguity.

I regret not calling it earlier. The minute we did, the recurring fires that had been draining us
for months started getting fixed.

Find the words that compress judgment for your team. A phrase that ends arguments. A term that gives
permission. Language like this isn't decoration—it's infrastructure.

## The payoff

There's a quiet moment when it starts to stick.

Engineers defend customers with test suites they wrote without being asked. PMs stop apologizing for
slowing a feature during a Code Red; they ask what they can do to help. People start solving
problems before you know the problems exist.

The people who thrive in this environment don't just tolerate the turbulence—they generate it. They
bring drafts instead of questions. They make the people around them faster, braver, clearer.

**I call these people exothermic: they produce more energy than they consume.** Directed chaos
doesn't just build resilience. It builds exothermic people.

The surface still looks busy. Underneath, there's a steadiness you can't get by chasing calm. It
comes from rough seas, not still water.

## The invitation

None of this is a plea for reckless change. Unmanaged chaos breaks people. Directed chaos makes
them.

You expose your people to turbulence, but you go through it with them. You give them structure. You
give them language. You don't flinch in the first storm.

And then, the next time, they don't either.

If you want to try the pattern yourself: remove the cushion of patch-thinking. In your next decision
meeting, forbid patches for ten minutes. Ask people to describe the system they wish they had—not in
a dreamy way, but concretely. What would be true if you could wave a wand? That's the structure you
add: a clear destination that makes every step feel directional.

The paradox is that if you do this long enough, calm returns. Not the fragile calm of a team that's
never been tested, but the earned calm of one that has weathered real storms.

Resilience isn't something you can give people. It's something they build by going through storms.
So give them storms worth weathering. Teach them to yearn for the sea. Then give them a ship worth
sailing.
