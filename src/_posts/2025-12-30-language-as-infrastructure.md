<!-- SCAFFOLD: Material cut from Directed Chaos + older draft content -->

## The thesis

Language is infrastructure. Chosen carefully, words become load-bearing.

A shared vocabulary compresses judgment. It lets people make decisions without escalating, because
the criteria are already embedded in the terms they use.

Find the words that compress judgment for your team. A phrase that ends arguments. A term that gives
permission. Language like this isn't decoration—it's infrastructure.

## Champion (naming a role)

"Owner" was too soft. It sounded like a label. So we named the role **champion**—and that word did
real work after the fact.

A champion isn't a PM with a new hat. It's the person who carries the project when it gets heavy.
They cut scope, pull in the right people, and write the story of what's true. Their name stays
attached when the project is ugly.

If there's no champion, it's not a project. It's a wish.

## Code Red (a word that stops the line)

When everything is urgent, nothing is. Our platform started thrashing as we moved upmarket. The team
felt it, customers felt it, and we were still juggling feature work like nothing had changed.
Everyone knew something was wrong, but nobody had license to say it.

Calling a Code Red didn't create panic. It created calm. Suddenly pausing the roadmap wasn't a
personal failure—it was a company decision. People don't burn out from hard work. They burn out from
ambiguous work. Code Red removed the ambiguity.

I regret not calling it earlier. The minute we did, the heaviest rocks started to move.

A good word doesn't just describe reality. It changes what people can do next.

## Desired state (from older draft)

We normalized **desired state**. When someone proposed a patch, I'd ask them to describe the system
we wished we already had—concrete, not dreamy.

Patches shifted from "how do we hide this hole?" to "what's one brick we can lay the right way?" It
sounds semantic until you do it in a meeting and feel the room tilt from firefighting to
architecture.

Desired state does two things: it forces you to name the shape of the problem, and it absolves you
from fixing all of it right now. You just have to move one notch toward what you actually want.

## The tactic: Forbid patches

If you want one tactic to steal tomorrow: forbid patches for the first ten minutes of your next
decision meeting. Make the team write the desired state in plain words. Then pick the one step you
can take this week that moves you toward it. The debate shrinks. Morale rises.

## QA removal (example of the pattern)

The same pattern guided one of the most controversial changes we made: we dropped QA as a separate
function.

We didn't drop testing. We dropped the idea that quality lives in another department.

Not because quality doesn't matter. Because quality had become something you got from another team,
like a notarized stamp. Engineers would write code, toss it over, and wait for absolution.
Responsibility diffused in proportion to the number of handoffs.

We removed the handoff. Ownership didn't vanish—it concentrated. The release checklist moved to the
person who wrote the code—and their name stayed on it.

The first cycle was messy on purpose. We shipped bugs we used to pay someone else to catch. We
reverted. We apologized. It felt wrong for about a week and necessary by the second—and then
engineers started writing better tests because there was no one else to write them. Reviews got
sharper because the cost of a lazy review arrived at your door, not someone else's.

**Ownership isn't a belief you argue someone into. It's a weight you let them feel.**
