<!-- SCAFFOLD: Material cut from Directed Chaos + expansion ideas -->

## The concept

The people who thrive in high-ownership environments don't just tolerate turbulence—they generate
it. They pick fights with reality before reality picks one for them.

I call these people **exothermic**: they produce more energy than they consume.

Endothermic people can be brilliant—but they are a tax. They need energy poured into them to produce
output. Exothermic people are a generator. Every room they enter gets warmer.

<!-- Tobi Lütke used this metaphor: "Every atom jiggles faster around them. There's no
chance for stasis. Nothing is frozen." Worth attributing/citing. -->

## What exothermic looks like

They bring drafts instead of questions. They kill ambiguity for the people around them. They make
everyone faster.

"Be more exothermic" isn't vague when you can translate it to:

- Close the loop before you leave the room
- Don't wait for permission to think
- Bring a draft next time
- Kill ambiguity for others, don't export it

## It's not a trait—it's an output

That's not a personality trait. It's what ownership plus clarity produce.

Directed chaos builds exothermic people. Give someone real responsibility, make thinking survivable
(not unnecessary), and the energy starts flowing outward.

## Hiring for exothermic

Once you have the word, you can hire for it.

## Coaching toward exothermic

Once you have the word, you can coach it.

What conditions enable it? -->

## The payoff

People start solving problems before you know the problems exist. PMs stop apologizing for slowing
features—they ask what they can do to help. Engineers defend customers with test suites they wrote
without being asked.

The surface still looks busy. Underneath, there's a steadiness you can't get by chasing calm. It
comes from rough seas, not still water.
