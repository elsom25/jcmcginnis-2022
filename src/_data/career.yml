# Inflection points organized by era for visual grouping
eras:
  - name: The Foundation
    company: Boltmade
    url: http://boltmade.com/
    years: "2013–2016"
    points:
      - lesson: "Build a lot. Most of it won't matter. That's the point."
        byline: Learning to ship fast, go deep, and be genuinely confident
        detail: |
          Dozens of projects. Every language, framework, industry imaginable. What emerged: there's a common core to building software, but the magic is in going deep. Knowing Ruby's memory patterns let us do impossible things. Learning to be genuinely confident—not faking it—in domains we'd only known for weeks. Stop worrying about learning the "right" thing. Be curious. Chase what excites you.

  - name: The Growth
    company: Shopify
    url: https://www.shopify.com/
    years: "2016–2025"
    duration: "8+ years"
    points:
      - lesson: "Move fast to explore. Move slow to commit."
        byline:
          Discovering that short-term and long-term speed are different games
        period: "2016–2018"
        detail: |
          Multi-currency was open-heart surgery on how money was modeled at Shopify. Dozens of prototypes—we moved fast. But we took the time to find THE right answer, knowing how hard it would be to change later.

      - lesson: "The best thing you can build is a team that doesn't need you"
        byline: Transitioning from builder to builder of builders
        period: "2018–2020"
        detail: |
          I found myself doing less building and more activating—championing projects, unblocking teams, the work that makes work happen. And I loved it. Especially this: most people deeply underestimate themselves. Holding them to a bar they thought was impossible, then watching them clear it. People are the hardest problem. I've always chased the hardest problems.

      - lesson: "Delegation isn't distance"
        byline: Staying in the details while raising others to meet you there
        period: "2020–2022"
        detail: |
          The trap: stepping back and letting teams "figure it out." Real delegation is staying in the work WITH them—not saving them from every spike, but being the wall they learn to climb. Trust, but verify. Push on the details. Get close to the right work, and it sets the stage for everything else.

      - lesson: "Chaos is good... if directed"
        byline: Building resilience through intentional turbulence
        period: "2022–2025"
        detail: |
          Layoffs. Pivoting the team every six months. Not avoiding chaos—harnessing it. The goal was never stability. It was building teams that are resilient, adaptable, unstoppable. Comfort is where growth goes to die.

      - lesson: Now prove it works anywhere
        byline: Company building through directed chaos
        detail: |
          Every lesson distilled into one question: can I transform a company—fast—using everything I've learned? Build high-agency teams from scratch. Ship relentlessly. Embrace the chaos that others avoid. This chapter is still being written, but the early results are clear.
