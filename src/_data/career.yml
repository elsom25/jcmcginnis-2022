  - name: The Foundation
    company: Boltmade

    years: "2013–2016"

      - lesson: "Build a lot. Most won't matter. That's the point."
        byline: Trusting instincts over process
        proof: "8 products · 4→28 people"
        detail: |
          Dozens of projects. Every language, framework, industry. The magic isn't breadth—it's depth. Knowing Ruby's memory patterns let us ship what others couldn't. Genuine confidence in domains we'd only known for weeks. Stop chasing the "right" thing. Chase what excites you.

  - name: The Crucible
    company: Shopify
    url: https://www.shopify.com/
    years: "2016–2025"
    duration: "8+ years"
    points:
      - lesson: "Move fast to explore. Move slow to commit."
        byline: Short-term speed and long-term speed are different games
        period: "2016–2018"
        proof: "$B+ GMV · 1yr architecture"
        detail: |
          Multi-currency was open-heart surgery on Shopify's money model. Dozens of prototypes—fast. One year to find the right architecture—slow. That foundation now powers Shopify Markets and billions in international GMV. The trap: treating exploration and commitment as the same game.

      - lesson: "The best thing you can build is a team that doesn't need you"
        byline: From builder to builder of builders
        period: "2018–2020"
        proof: "M+ customers · 30+ internal teams"
        detail: |
          Bulk Account Inviter onboarded millions of B2B customers. Destinations became a service 30+ internal teams depend on. Less building, more activating others. Most people underestimate themselves. Hold them to a bar they thought was impossible. Watch them clear it. People are the hardest problem—and one worth solving.

      - lesson: "Delegation isn't distance"
        byline: Close to the work, not above it
        period: "2020–2022"
        proof: "10+ teams · Metaobjects launch"
        detail: |
          Shopify.plus launch across 10+ cross-functional teams. Metaobjects—an entirely new primitive for custom data, now core to thousands of stores. The trap: stepping back and letting teams "figure it out." Real delegation means staying in the work. Not saving them from every spike—being the wall they learn to climb. Trust, but verify.

      - lesson: "Directed chaos builds resilience"
        byline: Resilience comes from storms, not shelter
        period: "2022–2025"
        proof: "50+ engineers · 6 pivots"
        detail: |
          50+ engineers. 80+ R&D-wide. Mission pivoted every six months. Layoffs hit. Not avoiding chaos—harnessing it. The goal was never stability. It was teams that adapt. Teams that don't break. Comfort is where growth goes to die.

      - lesson: "Prove it's not luck—and set up what comes next"
        byline: Big company lessons. Startup speed.
        proof: "0→1 AI · Series B · Company reinvention"
        detail: |
          GrowthLoop isn't a typical 0→1. The company existed for years—now it's chasing hypergrowth. AI is the new frontier. The rest is reinvention. My experiment: big company scale with just the right rails. Enough structure to accelerate, not enough to kill speed. Everything learned, applied at once. This one's live.
