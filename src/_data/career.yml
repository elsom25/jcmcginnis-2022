  - name: The Foundation
    company: Boltmade
    url: http://boltmade.com/
    years: "2013–2016"
    points:
      - lesson: "Build a lot. Most of it won't matter. That's the point."
        byline: Where I learned to trust my instincts
        proof: "8 products · 4→28 people"
        detail: |
          Dozens of projects. Every language, framework, industry. What emerged: the magic isn't breadth—it's going deep. Knowing Ruby's memory patterns let us do impossible things. Learning to be genuinely confident—not faking it—in domains we'd only known for weeks. Stop chasing the "right" thing. Chase what excites you.

  - name: The Crucible
    company: Shopify
    url: https://www.shopify.com/
    years: "2016–2025"
    duration: "8+ years"
    points:
      - lesson: "Move fast to explore. Move slow to commit."
        byline: Short-term speed and long-term speed are different games
        period: "2016–2018"
        proof: "$B+ GMV · 1yr architecture"
        detail: |
          Multi-currency was open-heart surgery on how money was modeled at Shopify. Dozens of prototypes—we moved fast. But we took a year to find and ship the right architecture, knowing how hard it would be to change later. That foundation now powers Shopify Markets and billions in international GMV. The trap is treating exploration and commitment as the same game.

      - lesson: "The best thing you can build is a team that doesn't need you"
        byline: From builder to builder of builders
        period: "2018–2020"
        proof: "M+ customers · 30+ internal teams"
        detail: |
          Built Bulk Account Inviter—onboarded millions of B2B customers. Built Destinations—a service now used by 30+ internal teams. Less building for myself, more activating others. I loved it. Most people deeply underestimate themselves. Hold them to a bar they thought was impossible, then watch them clear it. People are the hardest problem—and one worth solving.

      - lesson: "Delegation isn't distance"
        byline: Close to the work, not above it
        period: "2020–2022"
        proof: "10+ teams · Metaobjects launch"
        detail: |
          Led shopify.plus launch across 10+ cross-functional teams. Shipped Metaobjects—an entirely new primitive for how merchants structure custom data, now core to how thousands of stores operate. The trap: stepping back and letting teams "figure it out." Real delegation is staying in the work with them—not saving them from every spike, but being the wall they learn to climb. Trust, but verify. Push on the details.

      - lesson: "Directed chaos builds resilience"
        byline: Resilience comes from storms, not shelter
        period: "2022–2025"
        proof: "50+ engineers · 6 pivots"
        detail: |
          Built an organization of 50+ engineers (80+ R&D-wide). Mission pivoted every six months. Not avoiding chaos—harnessing it. Layoffs hit. The goal was never stability. It was teams that are resilient, adaptable, unstoppable. Comfort is where growth goes to die.

        byline: Everything learned, applied at once
        proof: "0→1 · Series B"
        detail: |
          Building 0→1 on an AI-first product. High-agency teams from scratch. Relentless shipping. The chaos others avoid. This one's live.
