I had the pleasure of being one of a few external speakers at Gartner's Application Innovation
Summit in Vegas, May 2023.

A 30-minute dive into building high-trust teams—inspired by my [QCon talk](/talks/qcon/), but
condensed and adjusted to resonate with enterprise technology leaders. The principles apply whether
your team is remote, hybrid, or fully in-person.
