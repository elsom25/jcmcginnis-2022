I had the pleasure of being one of a few external speakers at Gartner's Application Innovation
Summit, Vegas in May 2023, to share a 30-minute dive into **building high-trust teams**. Inspired by
my [QCon talk](/speaking/qcon/), but condensed and adjusted to apply to in-person teams more
clearly. No video, unfortunately, but the slides are available:
