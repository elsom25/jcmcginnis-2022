I was honoured to be part of the
[Hybrid Work Strategies](https://plus.qconferences.com/track/nov2022/after-hybrid-work-strategies)
track at QCon San Francisco in November 2022.

This talk explores what it actually takes to build high-trust teams when you can't rely on hallway
conversations and in-person chemistry. It's not about tools or processes—it's about authenticity,
psychological safety, and the small daily choices that compound into something extraordinary.
