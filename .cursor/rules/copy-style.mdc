# Copy Style Guide

## Core Principles

**Less is more.** Every word must earn its place. If a sentence works without a word, cut the word.

**Punch, don't explain.** Short sentences hit harder. Vary rhythm for impact. End sections with a landing punch.

**Active over passive.** "I build teams" not "Teams are built by me." "Trust unlocks it" not "It is unlocked by trust."

**Concrete over abstract.** "Ship what others thought was impossible" not "Achieve remarkable outcomes."

**Parallel structure.** "Trust first. Expect everything. Best ideas win." The rhythm creates memorability.

## Patterns That Work

### The Tight Trio
Three short punches in sequence:
- "High-trust teams. Engineering leadership. A decade of lessons."
- "RSS. Your reader. No algorithms."
- "Conference, podcast, or workshop—let's talk."

### The Reframe
Set up expectation, then subvert:
- "People are the hardest problem—and one worth solving."
- "Resilience comes from storms, not shelter."
- "Close to the work, not above it."

### The Landing Punch
End sections with something that sticks:
- "That's the work."
- "Trust is the multiplier."
- "This one's live."

### The Compressed Question
Implicit questions that make readers fill in the blank:
- "Prove it's not luck" (implies: was it?)
- "Trust is how." (implies: how what?)

## What to Cut

| Soft Pattern | Tighter Version |
|---|---|
| "I'm always up for..." | "Always up for..." |
| "Don't be a stranger" | "Reach out." |
| "I expect to work with people who..." | "People who..." |
| "On building X, the craft of Y, and..." | "X. Y. Z." |
| "Here's how I learned why" | (cut entirely—let content speak) |
| "If you're organizing... I'd love to hear from you" | "Conference, podcast, or workshop—let's talk." |

## Avoid

- **Lists disguised as sentences** ("X, Y, and Z" → "X. Y. Z.")
- **Hedging language** ("I think," "perhaps," "maybe")
- **Corporate-speak** ("impactful," "leverage," "synergy")
- **Explaining the obvious** (if the section title says it, don't repeat it)
- **Filler transitions** ("Here's how," "Let me explain," "In other words")

## Voice

Confident but not arrogant. Direct but not cold. The voice of someone who has done the work and knows what they're talking about—but invites you in rather than lecturing.

Think: trusted senior colleague, not TED talk speaker.

## Essay-Specific Lessons

### Show Effect, Not Metaphor
Bad: "Words become load-bearing." (describes what it IS)
Good: "The word ended arguments." (describes what it DOES)

When introducing vocabulary or concepts, show the work they do—not what they represent.

### Behavior > Jargon
Bad: "Everyone left 'aligned'"
Good: "Everyone left nodding"

Observable behavior lands harder than corporate terminology. Use their words only when skewering them.

### Verbs Carry Weight
| Soft | Hard |
|------|------|
| surface-level updates | thin updates |
| try to make work calm | chase calm |
| the same move | one move |

Harder verbs = more confidence = better punch.

### Remove Throat-Clearing
Bad: "There's another way. I call it **directed chaos**:"
Good: "There's another way: **directed chaos**—"

Don't announce what you're about to say. Just say it.

### Same Word Twice = Sloppy
If a distinctive word appears twice in quick succession, readers notice. Vary or cut.

### Concrete Before Philosophy
"Not all structure is process. Sometimes it's a word." only works AFTER you've shown the word in action. Philosophy without prior concrete example feels academic.

### Paint, Don't Name
Bad: "It was learned helplessness."
Good: "Work didn't start until the ritual blessed it. Decisions got parked until next week. Problems got phrased as 'blocked' so someone else could own them."

Show the dysfunction in specific behaviors. Let readers name it themselves.

### Cut Pithy If It Breaks Flow
A great line that interrupts the argument isn't great—it's an indulgence. Save it for another piece or cut it.

### Duplication = Compression Opportunity
If two paragraphs say similar things, they're asking to become one tight sentence.
