# Visual Design Principles

## Start with Physics, Not Code

Before implementing any visual effect, ask: **"What real-world phenomenon am I simulating?"**

- **Glow** = light diffusing through atmosphere → needs soft falloff in ALL directions
- **Shadow** = light blocked by object → soft edges, directional
- **Timeline/progress** = journey through time → clear start/end, smooth progression
- **Sticky element** = physical anchoring → should feel "attached" to something solid

When an implementation looks wrong, stop coding and revisit the physics. Chasing symptoms (adjusting values) without understanding the cause leads to iteration loops.

## Taste Markers: Refined vs Generic

| Generic (Avoid) | Refined (Aim For) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Same pattern repeated | Variation that feels intentional |
| Hard edges, sharp boundaries | Soft transitions, natural falloff |
| Static elements | Responds to user (scroll, hover) |
| Single layer | Multiple subtle layers creating depth |
| Loud, obvious effects | Barely-there effects you feel more than see |
| Fighting the medium | Working WITH browser rendering |

**Key insight:** Refined design often means *reducing* intensity while *increasing* complexity (more layers, softer values, more gradual transitions).

## Layering for Depth

When creating depth effects (glows, shadows, backgrounds):

1. **Outer layer** - Wide, very soft, barely visible (opacity 8-12%)
2. **Mid layer** - Medium spread, soft (opacity 15-20%)
3. **Inner layer** - Tighter, slightly more visible (opacity 20-25%)

The combination creates perceived depth without any single layer being obvious.

## Color Transitions

- Gradients should have clear anchor points (start, middle, end)
- Use brand colors as anchors, let transitions blend naturally
- In dark sections, colored overlays should be visible in BOTH light and dark modes
- Test at multiple scroll positions and viewport sizes

## The "Off" Feeling

Trust your gut when something feels "off." Common causes:

- Hard edges where there should be soft falloff
- Missing depth (needs more layers)
- Effect too loud (reduce opacity, not layers)
- Fighting CSS natural behavior (overflow, stacking)
