Leaders must build teams and organizations that are not just receptive to change, but thrive on it. Yet change is hard. It's hard to track, hard to understand, and hard to manage. But it doesn't have to be.

## Remember the past

> “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”
>
> – George Santayana, The Life of Reason, 1905.

Forgetting our origins is a common human oversight. Our memory is selective, often influenced by current circumstances, which leads to a loss of valuable insights gained through experience. And how can we know we're moving forward if we don't know where we've been?

But remembering is not just important — it's essential. It's how we can see the incredible progress we've made, learn from our mistakes, and build on our wins. Its how we can see the forrest from the trees; remaining grounded so we can focus on what truly matters.

## Treat your organization like a product

Your organization is a **living product** — one that grows, changes, and adapts, with its own rich history. It has personality: your culture and purpose. And if you plan to be successful, it will be dynamic and ever-evolving.

There's a lot of ways to think about your organization as a product, but one of the easiest first steps is to think about it in terms of **releases**. Just like a product, your organization will go through changes, updates, and improvements. And if you package these together _just right_ you can tell a powerful story on how your organization continues to evolve. It becomes a testament to your growth journey.

And in tracking those stories — collective bets across strategy, structure, and practices — you'll get better at each future bet you have to make here; equipped with knowledge and clear-eyed insights.

## Crafting releases

So what goes into a great release? It's a mix of the big and small, the strategic and the tactical. It's the big bets and the small tweaks. It's the changes that matter, always with the context and perspective to remember _why_. It's the story of your organization, told through the lens of change.

As you build this, **start simple**. A bullet-point list in a shared document. Ensure its both user-friendly but simple to maintain. A straightforward, easily accessible record ensures that this practice enhances transparency and collective memory.

With each release, track the changes _that matter_. After doing this actively for the past couple years, I've found these 3 buckets, when packaged together with _the why_ to be sufficient:

1. Aims and strategy
2. Structure and teams
3. Defaults and programs

### 1. Aims and strategy

**The why and what**. The reason this organization exists.

This space can be huge and often _over invested in_. Let's focus on just vision, motivating metrics, and roadmap:

- Your **clear and succinct vision** captures why you exist. 1–2 sentences at most. Stable, but that makes all changes meaningful.
- Your **motivating metrics** bring cold-reality to your vision. Think star guides over a map, expect these to be easier to look back against and only be clear on long-term time horizons.
- Your **short-term roadmap or tactics** highlight the real work ahead. This is what we're actually doing day-to-day to make that pithy vision and motivating metrics _happen_.

### 2. Structure and teams

**The who**. How we assemble ourselves to get things done.

Reporting lines are what everyone cares about, but think wider. Who-reports-to-who _is important_ to track, but you can give power to your other structures by naming and tracking them. Your cross-functional teams, working groups, squads, etc. are how you actually do things at the end of the day. So give them the weight they often lack.

### 3. Defaults and programs

**The how**. Your defaults on how teams work day-to-day.

Capture the defaults you've adopted. And remember: **we are what we do** ultimately — think about your culture here too. The systems and programs that keep your systems up, tech debt down, and people energized. The social and everything in-between. Everything that meaningfully makes your organization _work_. You'll be surprised how quickly this gets better with the intention and awareness that come from tracking it.

### Releases and versioning

What is a release but a new version, ultimately. There's dozens of ways to approach this, but I'm a fan of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as a base. It's simple, clear, and easy to understand. And it communicates magnitude clearly. I think through every change with this lens:

- **Major versions** signal fundamental change. These are the big shifts that change the way you work with wide-reaching impact. Think significant reorgs, pivots in purpose, or overhauls in operations.
- **Minor version** signal non-disruptive additions. These are meaningful additions to how you work, but don't dramatically change what already exists. Think new teams, new product bet, or an emergent operating default.
- **Patches** are for tune ups. Not often necessary, but available when it helps.

## A "real" example

There's a lot here! Let's us pull this all together and see how this could actually work. We'll review a changelog for the fictional "CodeCraft Inc."

Looking at their their changelog, you gain quite a bit! A sense of culture (from this existing through how it's written). What they care about (from what is tracked through where changes happen). And you can see the story of this company is reacting and evolving as it goes…

# CodeCraft Changelog

_Living document capturing key organizational changes of CodeCraft. Helps us remember where we came from and how we got to where we are today. Part of treating our human-organization more like a product itself._

## v3.0.0 - 2023-10-17

Announced at the company-wide Town Hall ([slides](#), [recording](#)). Pivoting our aim to AI-driven education for the next generation. We're flattening our structure, but keeping many of our practices the same. Adding our first written 'Who we are' document as well.

**_Key docs: [v3.0 Org chart](#), [v3.0 Roadmap](#), [v2.1 Operational defaults](#), [v1.0 Who we are](#)_**

1. **Aims & strategy**
  - **[MAJOR]** Mandate got extended: **AI-driven** education for the next generation.
    - Even with this, our motivating metrics remain the same: increase total of college-equivalent expertise; while decreasing total education spend.
  - **[MAJOR]** [v3.0 Roadmap](#) (from [v2.2 Roadmap](#)): With the focus on AI now, we're dropped our VR projects (that bet didn't pan out).
2. **Structure and teams**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v3.0 Org chart](#) (from [v2.2 Org chart](#)): Our biggest structural change so far! A lot of folks are in new teams with new managers. We've been hearing everyone's feedback and have finally rebalanced skills and tenure. We also made sure teams line-up to the new roadmaps.
  - We've also adjusted titles to match the new formalized company title system (Tech Lead → Staff Engineer OR Manager).
3. **Defaults and programs**
  - **[MINOR]** [v2.1 Operational defaults](#) (from [v2.0 Operational defaults](#)): Mostly the same, but clarified some of the emergent norms around remote work and Fantastic Fridays.
  - **[NEW]** [v1.0 Who we are](#): Finally capturing a more detailed take on _who we are_, and what will help you be successful here. This is a place for high-agency actors through-and-through.

## v2.2.0 - 2023-04-08

Shared as a video recording ([link](#)) in Slack. The team and product have been crushing it! We're codifying the dynamic structure we've been using for a while now; and we're adding a new VR team to double down on the tailwinds.

**_Key docs: [v2.2 Org chart](#), [v2.0 Operational defaults](#)_**

1. **Aims & strategy**: N/A
2. **Structure and teams**
  - **[MINOR]** [v2.2 Org chart](#) (from [v2.1 Org chart](#)): We've added a new VR team to double down on the tailwinds we're seeing in the market. We've also added a new 'floating' team to help with cross-team coordination.
3. **Defaults and programs**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v2.0 Operational defaults](#) (from [v1.5 How to scrum](#)): We do a whole lot more than 'scrum' (and we're so far from scrum at this point why keep calling it that). So introducing the revamped _Operational defaults_, spanning the full suite of how we operate. Give it a read if you're new or want a refresher.

## v2.1.3 - 2023-01-23

... and so on ...

## Smart(er) evolution with a changelog

Building an organizational changelog is more than just a record of changes.

It's a strategic approach that equips every team member with a deep understanding of our collective progress. It's a practical way to be experimental and adaptive, instilling an ethos of constant growth and change. It’s a pathway towards resilience and proactive adaptation, by making change itself a part of your organization's DNA.

**It's being ready for change, because change always comes.**
