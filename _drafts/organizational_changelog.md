Leaders must build teams and organizations that are not just receptive to change but thrive on it. Yet change is hard. It's hard to track, hard to understand, and hard to manage. But it doesn't have to be.

## Remember the past

> “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”
>
> – George Santayana, The Life of Reason, 1905.

We all forget the past. Our memory is selective and overly influenced by the current moment; the memories themselves change over time. Without safekeeping, we'll lose key insights and lessons learned through our experiences. We'll forget the why behind our decisions and the context that shaped them, and only have the outcomes that followed.

But remembering our past is not just important — it's essential. It's how we see the incredible progress we've made, learn from our mistakes, and build on our wins. It's how we see the forest from the trees and remain grounded. The past gives us the context to understand the present and the foresight to shape the future.

## Treat your organization like a product

Your organization is truly a product in its own right. It has an incredibly rich history full of change and reaction. It has a deep personality, coming from not just the people but what they do together every day. It exists to _do something_ in this world. And if you plan to be successful, it will be dynamic and ever-evolving, growing, changing, and constantly adapting.

There are many ways to think about your organization as a product, but an excellent starting place is to think about its changes as **releases**. As your product goes through changes, updates, and improvements, you can package these together to tell a powerful story. And in tracking those stories — collective bets across strategy, structure, and defaults — you'll get better at each future bet you have to make here; equipped with knowledge and clear-eyed insights.

## Crafting releases

So what goes into a great release? It's a mix of the big and small, the strategic and the tactical. It's the big bets and the small tweaks. It's the changes that matter, always with the context and perspective to remember _why_. It's the story of your organization, told through the lens of change.

As you build this, it can become overwhelming fast. **Keep it simple**: A bullet-point list in a shared document. With each release, track the changes _that matter_, which I find boils down to 3 simple things:

1. Aims and strategy
2. Structure and teams
3. Defaults and programs

By keeping this simple it ends up being easy to maintain and user-friendly. There's enough richness here to grow your collective memory and begin making better bets. And you'll be pleasantly surprised by how quickly things improve from the intention and awareness that naturally arises from tracking changes.

### 1. Aims and strategy

**The why and what**. The reason this organization exists.

You can do more, but I focus on just vision, motivating metrics, and roadmap:

- Your **clear and succinct vision** captures why you exist. 1–2 sentences at most. Stable, but that makes all changes meaningful.
- Your **motivating metrics** bring cold reality to your vision. Think star guides over Google Maps; you won't see your movement immediately, but you'll know you're going in the right direction.
- Your **short-term roadmap** highlights the real work ahead. This is what your teams do day-to-day and ultimately, makes the vision and metrics _happen_.

### 2. Structure and teams

**The who**. How we assemble ourselves to get things done.

Reporting lines are what everyone cares about, so track that while also thinking wider. Your other structures, from cross-functional teams to working groups, are often the drivers of progress. So give them the power they deserve by naming and tracking them with the same rigor as your reporting structures.

### 3. Defaults and programs

**The how**. Your defaults on how teams work day-to-day.

Capture the defaults you've adopted. And remember: **we are what we do** ultimately — so think about your culture here too. The systems and programs that keep your systems up, tech debt down, and people energized. The socials and everything in between. Everything that meaningfully makes your organization _work_. All of those end up describing _who you collectively are_.

### Releases and versioning

What is a release but a new version? There are dozens of ways to approach this, but I'm a fan of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as a base. It's simple, clear, and easy to understand. And it easily communicates magnitude. I think through every change with this lens:

- **Major versions** signal fundamental change. These are the big shifts that change the way you work with a wide-reaching impact. Think of significant reorgs, pivots in purpose, or overhauls in operations.
- **Minor version** signal non-disruptive additions. These are meaningful additions to how you work, but don't dramatically change what already exists. Think new teams, a new product bet, or an emergent operating default.
- **Patches** are for tune-ups. Not often necessary, but available when it helps.

Major versions are rare, but they're the big moments that define your organization. Minor versions are more common, but they're the steady drumbeat of progress. Patches are the small tweaks that keep everything running smoothly, rarely with no visible commentary.

And your choice of version is itself an incredibly powerful tool — broadcasting intent and magnitude. Sometimes a major version is not much on paper, but is instead a clear message about the moment. Likewise, sometimes a minor version involves many changes, but stays minor because it's all part of the same story.

## A "real" example

There's a lot here! Let's pull this all together and see how this works by reviewing a changelog for the fictional "CodeCraft Inc."

Even this short snippet shares surprising insight into the company! You get a sense of culture from the changelog simply existing, but also in how it's written. You see what they care about, from what is tracked through where changes happen. And more! The story of this company is reacting and evolving as it goes…

# CodeCraft Changelog

_Living document capturing key organizational changes of CodeCraft. Helps us remember where we came from and how we got to where we are today. Part of treating our human-organization more like a product itself._

## v3.0.0 - 2023-10-17

Announced at the company-wide Town Hall ([slides](#), [recording](#)). Pivoting our aim to AI-driven education for the next generation. We're flattening our structure, but keeping many of our practices the same. Adding our first written 'Who we are' document as well.

**_Key docs: [v3.0 Org chart](#), [v3.0 Roadmap](#), [v2.1 Operational defaults](#), [v1.0 Who we are](#)_**

1. **Aims & strategy**
  - **[MAJOR]** Mandate got extended: **AI-driven** education for the next generation.
    - Even with this, our motivating metrics remain the same: increase total of college-equivalent expertise; while decreasing total education spend.
  - **[MAJOR]** [v3.0 Roadmap](#) (from [v2.2 Roadmap](#)): With the focus on AI now, we're dropped our VR projects (that bet didn't pan out).
2. **Structure and teams**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v3.0 Org chart](#) (from [v2.2 Org chart](#)): Our biggest structural change so far! A lot of folks are in new teams with new managers. We've been hearing everyone's feedback and have finally rebalanced skills and tenure. We also made sure teams line-up to the new roadmaps.
  - We've also adjusted titles to match the new formalized company title system (Tech Lead → Staff Engineer OR Manager).
3. **Defaults and programs**
  - **[MINOR]** [v2.1 Operational defaults](#) (from [v2.0 Operational defaults](#)): Mostly the same, but clarified some of the emergent norms around remote work and Fantastic Fridays.
  - **[NEW]** [v1.0 Who we are](#): Finally capturing a more detailed take on _who we are_, and what will help you be successful here. This is a place for high-agency actors through-and-through.

## v2.2.0 - 2023-04-08

Shared as a video recording ([link](#)) in Slack. The team and product have been crushing it! We're codifying the dynamic structure we've been using for a while now; and we're adding a new VR team to double down on the tailwinds.

**_Key docs: [v2.2 Org chart](#), [v2.0 Operational defaults](#)_**

1. **Aims & strategy**: N/A
2. **Structure and teams**
  - **[MINOR]** [v2.2 Org chart](#) (from [v2.1 Org chart](#)): We've added a new VR team to double down on the tailwinds we're seeing in the market. We've also added a new 'floating' team to help with cross-team coordination.
3. **Defaults and programs**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v2.0 Operational defaults](#) (from [v1.5 How to scrum](#)): We do a whole lot more than 'scrum' (and we're so far from scrum at this point why keep calling it that). So introducing the revamped _Operational defaults_, spanning the full suite of how we operate. Give it a read if you're new or want a refresher.

## v2.1.3 - 2023-01-23

... and so on ...

## Smart(er) evolution with a changelog

Building an organizational changelog is more than just a record of changes.

It's a strategic approach that equips every team member with a deep understanding of our collective progress. It's a practical way to be experimental and adaptive, instilling an ethos of constant growth and change. It’s a pathway towards resilience and proactive adaptation, by making change itself a part of your organization's DNA.

**It's being ready for change, because change always comes.**
