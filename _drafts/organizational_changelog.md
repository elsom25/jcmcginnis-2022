Leaders must build teams and organizations that are not just receptive to change, but thrive on it. Yet change is hard. It's hard to track, hard to understand, and hard to manage. But it doesn't have to be.

## The importance of remembering

> “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”
>
> – George Santayana, The Life of Reason, 1905.

Forgetting our origins is a common human oversight. Our memory is selective, often influenced by current circumstances, which leads to a loss of valuable insights gained through experience. And how can we know we're moving forward if we don't know where we've been?

But remembering is not just important — it's essential. It's how we can see the incredible progress we've made, learn from our mistakes, and build on our wins. Its how we can see the forrest from the trees; remaining grounded so we can focus on what truly matters.

## Your organization is a living product

Consider your organization a living **product** — one that grows, changes, and adapts, with its own history, present, and future. It has a personality, culture, and purpose; it is not static but dynamic.

And how do we track changes to a product? **Version numbers** and **changelogs** that go hand-in-hand.

### Mechanics of organization versioning

Whatever format works for you is the right choice. But I'm a fan of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as a base. It's simple, clear, and easy to understand. It communicates magnitude clearly. And it's easy to adapt to orgs:

- **Major versions** signal fundamental change. These are the big shifts that change the way you work with wide-reaching impact. Think significant reorgs, pivots in purpose, or overhauls in operations.
- **Minor version** signal non-disruptive additions. These are meaningful additions to how you work, but don't dramatically change what already exists. Think new teams, new product bet, or an emergent operating default.
- **Patches** are for tune ups. Not often necessary, but available when it helps.

### Role of a changelog

Consider a changelog your organizational memoir — a tool to chronicle adjustments, rationalize decisions, and underscore impacts. It’s a testament to your growth journey, meant to be both user-friendly and simple to maintain. A straightforward, easily accessible record ensures that this practice enhances transparency and collective memory.

Start simple: a bullet-point list in a shared document. Keep it alive, changing as you go. And make it a tool for you too (not just for your org). Think historical bookmarks, context for new hires, or consolidation of other docs.

## What's this look like?

In documenting your organization's "versions," focus on:

1. **Organizational aims**: What are you trying to achieve? What are your goals and objectives? How are you measuring success?What are you working on now? What are you planning to work on next?
2. **Organizational structure**: How is your organization structured? Who reports to whom? What are the roles and responsibilities?
3. **Operational defaults and practices**: How do you work? What are your processes and procedures? What are your norms and values?

Each version encapsulates changes across these domains, digging into the why of the moment, building a clear historical perspective you ca learn from.

### Organizational aims

What and why we're here to do.

The clear and pithy "vision" of your organization encapsulating why you exist. This won't change often, but it's why changes here are so essential to track.

Anchoring that vision are your motivating metrics. These won't always be directly measurable, but they're the guiding stars. And certainly, they should be measurable in the long term.

Lastly, your current projects and initiatives. The things you're working on now to get you closer to your vision. And the things you're planning to work on next.

### Organizational structure

How we organize ourselves to pull this off.

This is what people look for first when a "reorg" happens, so track it. This is the who's who and who does what. It's the org chart, the roles and responsibilities, and the reporting lines. It's the structure that helps you get things done.

### Operational defaults and practices

How we work day-to-day to get our work done.

Your defaults to make things work well and your cultural anchors that fill in the gaps. The systems and programs that keep your systems up, tech debt down, and people energized. And everything in-between.

### Example: CodeCraft's changelog

# CodeCraft Changelog

_Living document capturing key organizational changes of CodeCraft. Helps us remember where we came from and how we got to where we are today. Part of treating our human-organization more like a product itself._

## v3.0.0 - 2023-10-17

Announced at the company-wide Town Hall ([slides](#), [recording](#)). Pivoting our aim to AI-driven education for the next generation. We're flattening our structure, but keeping many of our practices the same. Adding our first written 'Who we are' document as well.

**_Key docs: [v3.0 Org chart](#), [v3.0 Roadmap](#), [v2.1 Operational defaults](#), [v1.0 Who we are](#)_**

1. **Organizational aims**
  - **[MAJOR]** Completely new mandate: AI-driven education for the next generation.
  - **[MAJOR]** [v2.2 Roadmap](#) → [v3.0 Roadmap](#): With the focus on AI now, we're dropped our VR projects (that bet didn't pan out). Though we've kept our blockchain projects as they're still relevant; just slated for later.
2. **Organizational structure**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v2.2 Org chart](#) → [v3.0 Org chart](#): Our biggest structural change so far! We've rebalanced skills, tenure, and subdisiplines and are now organized around our new aim.
  - We've also adjusted titles to match the new formalized company title system (Tech Lead → Staff Engineer OR Manager).
3. **Operational defaults and practices**
  - **[MINOR]** [v2.0 Operational defaults](#) → [v2.1 Operational defaults](#): Mostly the same, but clarified some of the emergent norms around remote work and Fantastic Fridays.
  - **[MAJOR]** [v1.0 Who we are](#): Finally capturing a more detailed take on _who we are_, and what will help you be successful here. This is a place for high-agency actors through-and-through.

## v2.2.0 - 2023-04-08

Shared as a video recording ([link](#)) in Slack. The team and product have been crushing it! We're codifying the dynamic structure we've been using for a while now; and we're adding a new VR team to double down on the tailwinds.

**_Key docs: [v2.2 Org chart](#), [v2.0 Operational defaults](#)_**

1. **Organizational aims**: N/A
2. **Organizational structure**
  - **[MINOR]** [v2.1 Org chart](#) → [v2.2 Org chart](#): We've added a new VR team to double down on the tailwinds we're seeing in the market. We've also added a new 'floating' team to help with cross-team coordination.
3. **Operational defaults and practices**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v1.5 How to scrum](#) → [v2.0 Operational defaults](#): We do a whole lot more than 'scrum' (and it's so far from scrum at this point), so we've expanded this to cover the full suite of how we operate. Give it a read if you're new or need a refresher.

## v1.5.0 - 2023-01-23

... and so on ...

## Smart evolution through understanding

Building an organizational changelog is more than just a record of changes.

It's a strategic approach that equips every team member with a deep understanding of our collective progress. It's a practical way to be experimental and adaptive, instilling an ethos of constant growth and change. It’s a pathway towards resilience and proactive adaptation, by making change itself a part of your organization's DNA.

It's being ready for change, because change always comes.
