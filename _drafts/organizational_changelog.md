Building teams and organizations that can adapt to change is a critical skill for leaders. But how do you know if you're making progress? How do you ensure that the changes you're making are having the desired impact?

## Why remember?

Remembering where you came from is important; and it's so easy to forget. It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and lose sight of the bigger picture. It's easy to forget the struggles and successes that got you to where you are today. It's easy to forget the lessons you've learned along the way.

And this is only more true in an environment of constant change. There's so much going on that makes it easy to forget. And our brains are apt to gloss over the difficult times too — painting a rosier picture than reality. And that steals the lessons away from us.

But remembering is important; no essential. It helps you see the progress you've made. It helps you learn from your mistakes. It helps you build on your successes. It helps you stay grounded and focused on what's important.

## But how?

First, treat your organization as a living, breathing **product**. It grows, it changes, it adapts. It has a history, a present, and a future. It has a personality, a culture, and a purpose. It's not a static thing; it's dynamic and evolving.

And like most great products, we know **what version we're on**, and we know **what's changed**. We know what's been added, what's been removed, and what's been improved. We know what's been fixed, what's been broken, and what's been learned.

### Org versioning

There's lots of directions you can take this, but shifting language to "Org versions" instead of "Reorgs" opens the door. Having versions let's you start crafting a story of your organization, and gives excellent wayfinding for your team.

I've used [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as a guide for this. It's a simple and effective way to track changes to a product, so why can't it work for an organization too? Since there is rarely a "breaking change" in an organization, we can simplify it to:

- **Major**: Significant changes to the organization. These are the big shifts that change the way you work. This can come from any piece, but think major reporting line adjustments, a dramatically different aim, or an overhaul in programs & defaults.
- **Minor**: Smaller changes to the organization. These are the tweaks and adjustments that keep things running smoothly. This can be a new program, a new team, or a new process.
- **Patch**: Minor changes to the organization. These are the small fixes and improvements that make things better. This can be a small tweak to a process, a small change in a team, or a small adjustment in a program. I don't use this often, but it's there when you need it.

### Changelog

A changelog is a record of changes made to a project or system. It's a way to track what's been done, why it was done, and what the impact was. It's a way to remember where you came from and how you got to today.

A changelog can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. It can be a list of bullet points in a text file. It can be a spreadsheet. It can be a blog post. It can be a dedicated app. It can be whatever works best for you and your team.

In my experience, a changelog is most effective when it's simple and easy to maintain. It should be something that you can update quickly and easily. It should be something that you can refer back to often. It should be something that you can share with others.

## What to include?

What's important for each "version" of your organization? That's what you need to track. I've had success tracking changes across four categories:

1. **Organizational aims**: What are you trying to achieve? What are your goals and objectives? How are you measuring success?
2. **Organizational structure**: How is your organization structured? Who reports to whom? What are the roles and responsibilities?
3. **Roadmaps and plans**: What are your plans for the future? What are you working on now? What are you planning to work on next?
4. **Operational defaults and practices**: How do you work? What are your processes and procedures? What are your norms and values?

And of course, each "organizational version" includes the date, a summary, key links, and the changes to those key categories. This is the heart of your changelog.

### Organizational aims

These are the top-line purpose and motivations that your organization exists for. They won't change often, but it's why changes here are so essential to track.

Aim for clear and pithy statements that clearly identify what is important to you. This is why you exist after all.

Depending on your scope, you may find some measures help cement this. Don't expect you can measure them directly at this level — think of them as motivation. Though you should be able to tell if you're achieving them looking back.

### Organizational structure

This is the who's who and who does what. It's the org chart, the roles and responsibilities, and the reporting lines. It's the structure that helps you get things done. And this is what most people think of when they think of an organization. And what they often over focus on in an "org change." So we track it, but show how it is a smaller part of the whole. And as you start having org version changes _without_ reporting line changes, people will start to see the bigger picture.

### Roadmaps and plans

This is the what and when. It's the projects and initiatives that you're working on. It's the things that you're planning to do next. It's the roadmap that helps you get to where you want to go. And this is where the rubber meets the road. We have our high-level aims, our structures, and now what exactly we're building to get there.

### Operational defaults and practices

Lastly, this is the day-to-day how. It's our defaults that help us _do_. Our culture that drives the norms and unspoken practices. How teams operate successfully. How we keep our organization healthy to how we ensure our systems are healthy. And everything in-between.

This is how we get the real work done.

## An illustrative example

Let's look at a snapshot of (the made up) CodeCraft's changelog, an AI-driven education company, to see what this might look like and the story it can tell.

# CodeCraft Changelog

_Living document capturing key organizational changes of CodeCraft. Helps us remember where we came from and how we got to where we are today. Part of treating our human-organization more like a product itself._

## v3.0.0 - 2023-10-17

Announced at the company-wide Town Hall ([slides](#), [recording](#)). Pivoting our aim to AI-driven education for the next generation. We're flattening our structure, but keeping many of our practices the same. Adding our first written "Who we are" document as well.

**_Key docs: [v3.0 Org chart](#), [v3.0 Roadmap](#), [v2.1 Operational defaults](#), [v1.0 Who we are](#)_**

1. **Organizational aims**
  - **[MAJOR]** Completely new mandate: AI-driven education for the next generation.
2. **Organizational structure**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v2.2 Org chart](#) → [v3.0 Org chart](#): Our biggest structural change so far! We've rebalanced skills, tenure, and subdisiplines and are now organized around our new aim.
  - We've also adjusted titles to match the new formalized company title system (Tech Lead → Staff Engineer OR Manager).
3. **Roadmaps and plans**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v2.2 Roadmap](#) → [v3.0 Roadmap](#): With the focus on AI now, we're dropped our VR projects. Though we've kept our blockchain projects as they're still relevant; just slated for later.
4. **Operational defaults and practices**
  - **[MINOR]** [v2.0 Operational defaults](#) → [v2.1 Operational defaults](#): Mostly the same, but clarified some of the emergent norms around remote work and Fantastic Fridays.
  - **[MAJOR]** [v1.0 Who we are](#): Finally capturing a more detailed take on _who we are_, and what will help you be successful here. This is a place for high-agency actors through-and-through.

## v2.2.0 - 2023-04-08

Shared as a video recording ([link](#)) in Slack. The team and product have been crushing it! We're codifying the dynamic structure we've been using for a while now; and we're adding a new VR team to double down on the tailwinds.

**_Key docs: [v2.2 Org chart](#), [v2.0 Operational defaults](#)_**

1. **Organizational aims**
  - no-op
2. **Organizational structure**
  - **[MINOR]** [v2.1 Org chart](#) → [v2.2 Org chart](#): We've added a new VR team to double down on the tailwinds we're seeing in the market. We've also added a new "floating" team to help with cross-team coordination.
3. **Roadmaps and plans**
  - no-op
4. **Operational defaults and practices**
  - **[MAJOR]** [v1.5 How to scrum](#) → [v2.0 Operational defaults](#): We do a whole lot more than "scrum" (and it's so far from scrum at this point), so we've expanded this to cover the full suite of how we operate. Give it a read if you're new or need a refresher.

## v1.5.0 - 2023-01-23

... and so on ...
```

You can see the story of the company unfold. You can see the bets made _and why_. And while not every bet pans out, this helps us remember what led us to them so we don't over-fixate on the present.

## All together

Incorporating the concepts of versioning and changelogs into the fabric of your organization isn't just about documentation—it's about nurturing a culture of awareness, adaptability, and accountability. By explicitly recognizing the evolution of your organization, you're not only making it easier for your team to keep track of changes, but you're also cultivating a mindset that embraces growth and change.

This process allows every member of your organization to understand how their actions and the broader organizational shifts fit into the overarching narrative of progress. It ensures that decisions are made with a clear understanding of their historical context and potential impact. More importantly, it builds a collective memory, empowering your team to learn from the past, celebrate achievements, and approach future challenges with confidence and wisdom.

As leaders, our role goes beyond just managing the present; it's about stewarding our organization's journey. Embracing documented organizational versioning and maintaining a dynamic changelog are powerful steps towards creating a more resilient, reflective, and adaptive organization. So, let's start documenting our journey, not just for the sake of record-keeping, but as a strategic tool to foster a culture that values learning, celebrates progress, and is always ready for the next version of its future.
