Trust is the foundation of any relationship, and this is especially true when it comes to leadership in a team or organization. When team members trust their leader, they are more likely to be aligned with the goals and vision of the team, more engaged in their work, and more productive overall. Trust takes time to gain, yet can be easily lost; it is something that must be continuously nurtured and maintained. As a leader, it is essential to prioritize trust in all of your interactions with your team and to consistently demonstrate your commitment to honesty, transparency, and integrity. By leading with _trust first_, you can create a positive and supportive team culture that promotes collaboration, innovation, and success.

## Trust is the foundation (a.k.a. why it matters)

Trust is the foundation upon which high-performing teams are built. From the classic "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team," we know trust is the base. Without trust, teams cannot effectively engage in open and honest communication, resolve conflicts, make decisions, or hold each other accountable.

Alignment and engagement are two critical aspects of high-performing teams. When team members are aligned with the goals and vision of the team and are fully engaged in their work, they are more likely to be motivated and productive. Trust is essential for building both alignment and engagement within a team.

In addition to alignment and engagement, trust allows for failure, which is necessary for learning, growth, and iteration. When team members trust their leader and their peers, they are more likely to feel safe to take risks and try new things. This can lead to innovation and improved performance over the long term.

By building trust within a team, leaders can foster alignment, engagement, and a willingness to take risks and learn from failure, all of which are essential for driving world-class performance.

### Trust simplifies alignment

Trust allows team members to be their authentic selves, which frees up energy to focus on the work at hand. When team members feel safe to express their ideas and opinions, they are more likely to be fully present and engaged in the work. This open and honest communication can foster a sense of belonging and connection, which is essential for building a strong team culture.

When team members feel that they can speak openly and honestly without fear of reprisal or judgement, they are able to be fully present and free to challenge and question what's unclear.

This also makes it easier for direct feedback to be shared and heard: further driving alignment. Real, productive conflict is an important part of any healthy team. When team members feel comfortable sharing their opinions and ideas, even when they disagree with others, it allows for a more open and honest dialogue. This can lead to better decision making and improved outcomes.

All of these factors — honest conversations, direct feedback, and real, productive conflict — feed into building highly-aligned teams. Highly aligned teams are better able to work together towards a common goal, and require less communication overhead and coordination.

### Trust builds engagement

Trust is essential for building engagement within a team. When team members trust their leader and their peers, they are more likely to feel like they belong and are part of something bigger than themselves. This sense of belonging is essential for human beings, as we are social creatures and need to feel connected to others.

In addition to belonging, feeling like we are making a difference is also important for engagement. When team members trust their leader and the direction of the team, they are more likely to feel motivated and invested in the work they are doing.

Trust also enables the creation of fun, which helps keep work _lighter_, creates space for decompression, and offers everyone more room to make honest mistakes. All necessary to keep the environment of a high-performing team sustainable.

When team members trust their leader and their peers, they are more likely to feel like they belong, like they are part of something bigger than themselves, and like they are making a difference.

## Tactics for building trust (a.k.a. how to do it)

Trust has always taken effort to build well, but in today's digital-first world, building trust within a team is that much more challenging. With renewed intentionality and a focus on building deep human-trust, leaders can create a strong foundation for high-performing teams.

I believe there are three layers of building deep human-trust, which are useful in-person, but especially important in a digital-first world:

### Layer 1: Have fun

We're gonna start easy: simply, making space for _fun_. Light-hearted, easy to participate in, and intentionally social. Keep the space focused, recurring, and variable. This is our baseline — while it'll always be surface level, it create the initial connections that enables us to introduce deeper reaching activities where real trust is formed.

Aim for something simple and easy, that anyone on the team can facilitate (and ultimately, should be rotated amongst the team!). Think happy hours, coffee chats, and recurring game as the baseline. Though also ensure you make it a little "extra" every once in a while: digital escape rooms or (digital) zoo visits. The key here is to keep it fresh and exciting, so you can continuously nurture and invite folks to have fun together.

### Layer 2: Enable real talk

Now that we have our initial soft-trust connections established, we can go deeper. We can introduce activities that facilitate real trust. These are more intentional, and require a bit more effort to facilitate. They are also more focused, and should be narrow in scope.

> As we move into "real conversations," it's now critical to facilitate carefully. You need to establish ground-rules of engagement and make a space that is safe, inviting, and open for folks to share increasingly sensitive details. Facilitation is a whole other topic and skill I'll dive deep into in a future post — but for now: be present, fair, and kind, and it'll probably work out okay.

With real talk, we're looking to have deep, honest, and vulnerable conversations. Tactically, you'll want these to be driven by narrow and focused prompts that invite folks to add depth to their relationships with each other.

Some of my favourite tools for this are the NYT 36 Questions to Fall in Love and Ungame. These are all great tools to help facilitate these conversations that offer excellent prompts with a wide array of topics that can engage diverse groups. My usual operating mode here is 30-60 minutes to allow for a few rounds of questions, and then a debrief to share out and reflect on the experience.

All of this is about creating space to allow team members to have more vulnerable and authentic conversations which will help build trust and create a deeper understanding of each other, as more fully realized humans.

### Layer 3: The full human

- Once trust is established, in rare moments, its important to create space to be your full-human, to be vulnerable
- We have so few opportunities to share our stories, this is cathartic on a personal level, and builds trust on a team level
- Think: Life graph, targeted hard-hitting questions, etc.

The previous step is one you can stop at, but if you really want to create deep, long-lived human trust, you occasionally need to go deeper.

The full human is about creating space for team members to be their full, vulnerable selves. We have so few opportunities to share our stories and be vulnerable, and doing so can be cathartic on a personal level and help to build trust on a team level. Tools like the life graph or targeted, hard-hitting questions can be helpful for facilitating these conversations.

The life graph is a great tool for this, as it's a simple and straightforward way to share your story with your team. Everyone is given 15 minutes to draw a graph of their life, which will unlock lots of forgotten stories and memories, while also ensuring everyone has autonomy to only share what they are comfortable with. After that, get folks together and give them 5–10 minutes to "present" their life. This is a beautiful way to share your story, is a powerful way to start a conversation about your life and your experiences, and will be cathartic in ways that surprises most people. It's also deeply personal and humanizing, helping everyone on the team see the _full human_ behind the screen.

By building trust in these three layers, leaders can create a strong foundation for high-performing teams. Using all of these techniques in concert keep a healthy balance between light- and heavy-conversation, ensuring this remains a suite of activities you can run for the long-term. By focusing on having fun, enabling real talk, and creating space for vulnerability, leaders can create a positive and supportive team culture that promotes collaboration, innovation, and success.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, trust is the foundation of any team or organization, and is essential for building a high-performing team. When team members trust their leader and their team, they are more likely to be aligned with the goals and vision of the team, more engaged in their work, and more productive overall. Trust takes time to gain, yet can be easily lost; it is something that must be continuously nurtured and maintained to build strong, healthy relationships.

As a leader, it is important to prioritize trust in all of your interactions with your team and to consistently demonstrate your commitment to honesty, transparency, and integrity. By leading with _trust first_, you can create a positive and supportive team culture that promotes collaboration, innovation, and success.

There are several tactics that leaders can use to build trust within their team. These include creating opportunities for fun, facilitating deep and honest conversations, and creating space for team members to be their full, vulnerable selves. By building trust in these three layers, leaders can create a strong foundation for high-performing teams.

Overall, trust is essential for building strong, high-performing teams. By prioritizing trust in your leadership style and using tactics to build trust within your team, you can create a positive and supportive team culture that promotes collaboration, innovation, and success.
