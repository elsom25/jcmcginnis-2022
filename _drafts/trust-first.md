Trust is the foundation of any relationship. It's the foundation of any team. It's the foundation of any organization. In all my experiences, leading with _trust first_ is the best way to build a team that is aligned, engaged, and productive.

## Trust is the foundation

allows us to be our authentic selves, which frees energy to focus on the work
enables the creation of fun, which is necessary to make performance long-term

Three ideas (headings)

### Trust simplifies alignment

Honest conversations
Direct feedback
Real, productive conflict

all feed into building highly-aligned teams

Highly aligned teams require less communication overhead, less coordination, and can make micro-decisions faster and better.

### Trust breeds engagement

Human beings are social creatures. We need to feel like we belong. We need to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves. We need to feel like we're making a difference. Trust is the foundation of all of these.

### Trust drives world-class performance

allows for failure, which is necessary to learn and grow and iterate, fast

## Tactics for building trust

trust can form naturally with time, given the right environment, but in todays digital-by-default world, we need to be more intentional about building trust. And even in person, you can accelerate this with intentionality.

3-layers of building deep human-trust, which precursors the team-trust needed for high-performing teams

### Layer 1: Have fun

Focused, recurring, variable time to have fun
Light to access, forms the baseline to build on top of
Think: (digital) zoo, happy hours, recurring game times, etc.

### Layer 2: Enable real talk

Facilitated, deep and honest conversations
Narrow(er), and focused on a specific topic
Layers in depth to the relationships
Think: 36 question to fall in love, ungame, etc.

### Layer 3: The full human

Once trust is established, in rare moments, its important to create space to be your full-human, to be vulnerable
We have so few opportunities to share our stories, this is cathartic on a personal level, and builds trust on a team level
Think: Life graph, targeted hard-hitting questions, etc.
