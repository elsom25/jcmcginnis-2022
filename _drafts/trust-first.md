Trust is the foundation of every high-performing team or organization.

When team members trust their teams (and their leaders!), they are more aligned with the goals and vision of the team, more engaged in their work, and more productive overall. Trust takes time to gain, yet can be easily lost; it is something that must be continuously nurtured and maintained in order to build strong, healthy relationships.

As a leader, it is essential to prioritize trust in all of your interactions with your team. By leading with _trust first_, you too can create a positive and supportive team culture.

## Trust matters

Trust is the foundation of high-performing teams, as it allows for open and honest communication, resolution of conflicts, decision making, and accountability. Trust fosters alignment and engagement within a team, which are necessary for motivation and productivity. It also enables failure, which is crucial for learning, growth, and iteration. By building trust within a team, leaders can drive world-class performance through alignment, engagement, and a willingness to take risks and learn from failure.

### Trust simplifies alignment

Trust allows team members to be their authentic selves, which frees up energy to focus on the work at hand. When team members feel safe to express their ideas and opinions, they are more likely to be fully present and engaged in the work.

When team members feel that they can speak openly and honestly without fear of reprisal or judgement, they are able to be fully present and free to challenge and question what's unclear. This also makes it easier for direct feedback to be shared and heard, further driving alignment. Real, productive conflict is an important part of any healthy team, and when team members feel comfortable sharing their opinions and ideas, even when they disagree with others, it allows for a more open and honest dialogue. This will lead to better decision making and improved outcomes.

All of these factors contribute to building highly-aligned teams, which work towards a common goal with less communication overhead and coordination.

### Trust builds engagement

Trust is essential for building engagement within a team. When team members trust their leader and their peers, they are more likely to feel like they belong and are part of something bigger than themselves. This sense of belonging is essential for human beings, as we are social creatures and need to feel connected to others.

When team members trust the direction of their team, they are more likely to feel motivated and invested in the work they are doing. They'll see how what they do is part of something bigger, and how their work contributes to the team's success. This is especially important in remote-first teams, where it can be difficult to feel connected to the team and the work.

Engagement also invites fun, which helps keep work itself light, creates space for decompression, and offers everyone more room to make honest mistakes. All of these elements are necessary to sustain the environment of a high-performing team.

### Trust drives world-class performance

Trust is the base of the pyramid for high-performing teams, as-is often quoted from [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.tablegroup.com/product/dysfunctions/). Alignment and engagement are two critical aspects of high-performing teams, and trust fosters both. It also allows for failure, which is necessary for learning, growth, and iteration. By building trust within a team, leaders can drive world-class performance through alignment, engagement, and a drive to learn and iterate.

## Tactics to build trust

Building trust within a team is essential for high performance, but it can be challenging, especially in a digital-first world. By prioritizing deep human-trust through intentional activities and facilitated conversations, leaders can create a strong foundation for high-performing teams.

I believe there are three layers of building deep human-trust, which are useful in-person, but especially important in a digital-first world:

### Layer 1: Have fun

To build trust within a team, start by making space for fun. Focus on activities that are light-hearted, easy to participate in, and intentionally social. This is our baseline — it'll be surface level, it creates the initial connections that enables us to introduce deeper reaching activities where real trust is formed.

These activities should be recurring and variable, and should be led by different team members to keep things fresh. Examples include happy hours, coffee chats, and games. You should also add something extra in every once in a while, like a digital escape room or a virtual zoo visit. The key here is to keep it fresh and exciting, so you can continuously nurture and invite folks to have fun together.

### Layer 2: Enable real talk

Now that we have our initial connections established, we can go deeper. "Real talk" activities are more intentional and establish deeper trust, but require more facilitation. These activities are designed to help team members get to know each other better, and to share more about themselves through deep, honest, and vulnerable conversations.

> As we move into "real conversations," it's now critical to facilitate carefully. You need to establish ground-rules of engagement and make a space that is safe, inviting, and open for folks to share increasingly sensitive details. Facilitation is a whole other topic and skill I'll dive deep into in a future post — but for now: be present, fair, and kind, and it'll probably work out okay.

I recommend the [36 Questions That Lead to Love](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html) and [The Ungame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ungame). These are  great tools to help facilitate these conversations via excellent prompts. I suggest 30-60 minute to allow for a few rounds of questions and a debrief to reflect on the experience.

All of this is about creating space to allow team members to have more vulnerable and authentic conversations which will help build trust and create a deeper understanding of each other, as more fully realized humans.

### Layer 3: The full human

The previous step is one you can stop at, but if you really want to create deep, long-lived human trust, you occasionally need to go deeper.

The full human is about creating space for team members to be their full, vulnerable selves. We have so few opportunities to share our stories and be vulnerable, and doing so can be cathartic on a personal level and help to build trust on a team level. Tools like the life graph or targeted, hard-hitting questions can be helpful for facilitating these conversations.

The life graph is a simple and straightforward way to share your story with the team. Everyone is given 15 minutes to draw a graph of their life, which will unlock lots of forgotten stories and memories, while also ensuring everyone has autonomy to only share what they are comfortable with. After that, get folks together (recommending groups of 4–5) and give each person 5–10 minutes to "present" their life. This is a beautiful way to share your story, a powerful way to start deeper conversations, and is cathartic in ways that surprises most people. This deeply personal and humanizing experiences helps everyone on the team see the _full human_ we all are.

By building trust in these three layers, leaders can create a strong foundation for high-performing teams. Using all of these techniques in concert keep a healthy balance between light- and heavy-conversation, ensuring this remains a suite of activities you can run for the long-term. By focusing on having fun, enabling real talk, and creating space for vulnerability, leaders can create a positive and supportive team culture that promotes collaboration, innovation, and success.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, trust is the foundation of any team or organization, and is essential for building a high-performing team. When team members trust their leader and their team, they are more likely to be aligned with the goals and vision of the team, more engaged in their work, and more productive overall. Trust takes time to gain, yet can be easily lost; it is something that must be continuously nurtured and maintained to build strong, healthy relationships.

To build trust within a team, leaders can create opportunities for fun, facilitate deep and honest conversations, and create space for team members to be their full, vulnerable selves. By using these tactics, leaders can create a strong foundation for high-performing teams.

As a leader, it is essential to prioritize trust in all of your interactions with your team and to consistently demonstrate your commitment to honesty, transparency, and integrity. By leading with _trust first_, you can create a positive and supportive team culture that promotes collaboration, innovation, and success. Building trust is an ongoing process that requires intentionality and effort, but the benefits of a trusting team are well worth it.
