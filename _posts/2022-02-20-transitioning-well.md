Transitioning teams is hard. Transitioning teams as a leader has a whole swath of extra challenges. Whether it be a new job or a new role within your current company, there's plenty to figure out each time&hellip;

## My most recent transition

I moved to a new area in Shopify about 6 months ago to form a new organization ("product group" in Shopify parlance). I didn't yet have a mandate. I didn't know which teams I could pull in. I didn't know who I'd even be working with to pull this off.

No matter how many times I've made a change, each time a swarm of emotions floods my senses:

- Trepidation — Can I build great relationships with all the new humans?
- Worry — Can I find shared purpose for each of these teams? Can I add value?
- Fear — What's going to happen? Am I capable of pulling this off?

Imposter syndrome always finds its way to the forefront. Why does this always surface? I don't know. Not a psychologist. Just another human. Trying to figure out a little bit each time. But reflection, intentionality, and _naming things_ makes each change easier.

### Context gathering

Do I know the domain? Do I know the organization? Do I know the history? Do I know the people? Figure it out, fast.

Read everything I can find. Read documentation, tech designs, and a little code.

I must be upfront on what I don't know. Ask my team, ask past leaders, ask skip-levels. This honesty will build trust. This honesty will speed up my context gathering.

I won't know as much as I want before challenges appear. But aggressive focus on context will arm me to learn well from each wall I hit.

### Clear and authentic communication

While searching for context, I'm getting lots of time with my new team. This is a chance to be clear and authentic.

I have to be upfront about my goals, where I'll focus, and what I need from the team. What are the opportunities that brought me to this org? Why am I the person who came here?

While asking all my context gathering questions, this is a chance to start sharing. I'll share my ambition, my excitement. I'll share the opportunities I see for each of us. I'll share tidbits from my background that prepared me.

And while sharing, I'll be brutally honest on what I don't know. Don't know about this domain. Don't know about the technology. Don't know about the people. And I'll start asking for feedback _feverishly_.

### Deep care and trust

Don't discount how important trust and care is at this stage. While I'm nervous about this transition, I know my new team is doubly-so. Focus on building deep and caring relationships. Focus on being human with your humans.

Setup 1:1's with everyone. Spend time sharing history. Spend time sharing ambition. Spend time sharing concern. Spend time being human, together. But also, dig a little. Ask what can be better. Ask what should stay the same. Ask what challenges they're facing. And begin helping.

This takes time, but focus will help. Like with context, this trust gives me runway. Runway to learn and recover from the inevitable mistakes I'll make.

## All together

These three approaches lean on and compliment each other. Context gathering to understand what I've walked into. Direct, clear, and authentic communication about what I'm aiming to do. Deep deep care and trust for each human in my new team. There'll be new challenges (and old ones). This foundation prepares me (and this new team!) to weather them with grace and anti-fragility. This foundation makes this hard change, less hard.
