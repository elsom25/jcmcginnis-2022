description: Talk at Gartner on how to build high-trust teams.
---

I had the pleasure of being one of a few external speakers at Gartner's Application Innovation Summit, Vegas in May 2023, to share a 30-minute dive into **building high-trust teams**. Inspired by my [QCon talk]({% post_url 2022-12-06-high-trust-remote-teams-qcon %}), but condensed and adjusted to apply to in-person teams more clearly. No video unfortunately, but the slides are available:
