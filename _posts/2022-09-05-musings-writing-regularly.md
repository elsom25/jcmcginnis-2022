I want to write more, but I don't want to have to write _proper articles_ for everything on my mind&hellip;

## Musings for the soul

Why even write something like this? While I hope these occasional, short, and brief thoughts end up useful for all, I'm mostly doing this *for me*. Regular and active writing helps me process my thoughts.

I've been experimenting with writing weekly, _internally to Shopify_, for about 2 months now and have thoroughly loved it. So now I'm going to extend that experiment to writing weekly _externally_ as well.

I genuinely believe the practice of regular writing and reflection to be impactful in how you show up as a leader. This practice presents an opportunity to process and digest what you've learned. Further, the space and time you make to do this is itself a rare moment of thoughtful work in most leaders' wall-to-wall calendars. Finally, this is an excellent way to capture some core elements of a [Brag Doc](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/).

While these weekly musings won't always be something to brag about, they come from what's happening in your life week-over-week. It'll form a rough map of the problems you run into or the growth you are currently focused on. While not a replacement for a Brag doc outright, it's a good first step and augmentation.

So welcome to my first weekly musing, a musing on musing itself.

### Small technical note&hellip;

All my short writings, or _musings_, will be in the [Musings](/category/musings) category, so you can know what you're in for. As I mentioned, this is mostly for me, and many of these will be early previews of long-form articles to come. When inspiration (and mood) strike, I'll transform many of these into their final full-length form.
